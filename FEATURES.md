# Favn Roadmap & Feature Status

## Current Version

**Current release: v0.1**

Favn is in an early development stage. The core foundation is implemented, but the system is not yet production-ready.

This document tracks both **direction (roadmap)** and **progress (feature completion)**.

---

## Vision

Favn is a BEAM-native, asset-first orchestrator for business code.

It should make it easy to:

- define business-oriented assets in plain Elixir
- discover and reason about dependencies through code and documentation
- run deterministic workflows from those dependency relationships
- trigger work manually, via API, on schedules, by polling, or from events
- scale from one node to multiple BEAM nodes
- inspect everything through a UI
- extend via plugins
- support ETL/ELT, integrations, workflows, and AI agents

## Notes

- This roadmap defines **direction**, not exact implementation order.
- Features may evolve, but architectural principles should remain stable.
- Priority is always: **correct architecture > fast feature delivery**.
