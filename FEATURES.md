# Favn Feature Roadmap

## Versioning model

Favn is planned in three stages:

* **v0.1** — testable core release
* **v0.2** — complete core usable in development
* **v0.3** — production-grade release

This document is intended to be implementation-oriented. Each version includes:

* a goal description
* a feature list with status
* a scope description for each feature
* a task checklist that AI agents can execute against

Status values used in this document:

* **done** — implemented and expected to ship in that version
* **planned** — intended for that version but not yet implemented
* **candidate** — under consideration for that version
* **deferred** — intentionally moved to a later version

---

## v0.1 — Testable core release

### Goal

Ship a small but coherent core library that can be installed, exercised, and tested in host applications. The focus of v0.1 is correctness of the public API and the core runtime model, not production guarantees.

#### 4. Deterministic run planner

**Status:** done

**Scope**

Build a deterministic execution plan from one or more targets, with deduplicated nodes, topological ordering, and stage grouping.

**Todo list**

* [x] Verify run records are created for started runs.
* [x] Verify final statuses are persisted.
* [x] Verify `Favn.get_run/1` returns expected run state.

## v0.2 — Complete core usable in development

### Goal

Expand Favn from a testable runtime into a complete development-grade core. v0.2 should allow a developer to define assets, schedule runs, execute work asynchronously with controlled parallelism, inspect results across restarts, and iterate locally with confidence.

### Features

#### 1. Durable storage via SQLite adapter

## v0.3 — Production-grade release

### Goal

## v1.0 — Best-in-class orchestrator for heterogeneous ETL assets

### Goal

Evolve Favn from a development-grade core into a best-in-class orchestrator for heterogeneous ETL systems. By v1.0, Favn should orchestrate not only native Elixir assets, but also external transformation runtimes in a first-class way, starting with dbt. The core idea is that Favn owns orchestration, scheduling, cross-runtime dependencies, run history, and observability, while external runtimes continue to own their domain-specific execution semantics.

### Features

#### 1. Multi-runtime asset model

**Status:** planned

**Scope**

Extend the Favn asset model so native Elixir assets and externally discovered assets can coexist in one graph with one orchestration API.

**Todo list**

* [ ] Define a runtime abstraction for asset execution backends.
* [ ] Distinguish native Favn assets from external-runtime assets in the canonical asset model.
* [ ] Define shared metadata fields required across runtimes.
* [ ] Define runtime-specific metadata extension points.
* [ ] Ensure graph inspection APIs work consistently across mixed-runtime graphs.
* [ ] Add tests for mixed Elixir and external asset catalogs.

#### 2. First-class dbt integration

**Status:** planned

**Scope**

Support dbt as a first-class external runtime by discovering dbt resources from a project and exposing them as Favn assets.

**Todo list**

* [ ] Design a `favn_dbt` integration boundary or equivalent plugin/runtime package.
* [ ] Detect dbt projects in a host application or monorepo layout.
* [ ] Load dbt project metadata and artifacts needed for discovery.
* [ ] Discover dbt models, seeds, snapshots, and tests as Favn assets.
* [ ] Define canonical Favn refs for dbt-backed assets.
* [ ] Preserve dbt metadata needed for inspection and operator tooling.
* [ ] Add tests for discovery against representative dbt projects.

#### 3. dbt dependency and lineage translation

**Status:** planned

**Scope**

Translate dbt’s dependency graph into Favn’s asset graph so dbt resources participate correctly in planning, inspection, and orchestration.

**Todo list**

* [ ] Map dbt node dependencies into canonical Favn graph edges.
* [ ] Preserve upstream/downstream lineage from dbt artifacts.
* [ ] Decide how dbt tests should appear in the graph.
* [ ] Decide how ephemeral or non-materialized dbt nodes should be represented.
* [ ] Add tests for graph parity between dbt metadata and Favn graph inspection APIs.

#### 4. External runtime execution bridge for dbt

**Status:** planned

**Scope**

Execute dbt-backed assets through a supervised external runtime boundary rather than re-implementing dbt execution semantics inside Elixir.

**Todo list**

* [ ] Decide whether the execution bridge should be a sidecar, supervised OS process, or both.
* [ ] Define the contract between Favn and the dbt runtime boundary.
* [ ] Implement selection and invocation of dbt-backed assets through the bridge.
* [ ] Capture stdout, stderr, exit status, timings, and emitted artifacts.
* [ ] Normalize dbt execution results into Favn run-step records.
* [ ] Add tests for successful, failed, and interrupted dbt execution.

#### 5. Monorepo project layout support

**Status:** planned

**Scope**

Support host applications that keep Elixir code and dbt code in the same repository while allowing Favn to discover both cleanly.

**Todo list**

* [ ] Define conventions for configuring one or more external project roots.
* [ ] Support monorepo layouts with separate Elixir and dbt directories.
* [ ] Ensure startup discovery can load both native and dbt-backed assets.
* [ ] Add tests for common repository layouts.
* [ ] Document recommended monorepo structure.

#### 6. Cross-runtime orchestration

**Status:** planned

**Scope**

Allow native Elixir assets and dbt-backed assets to participate in the same orchestrated runs with explicit cross-runtime dependencies.

**Todo list**

* [ ] Define dependency declarations from Elixir assets to dbt assets.
* [ ] Define dependency declarations from dbt assets to Elixir assets where supported.
* [ ] Ensure planning works across mixed-runtime dependency graphs.
* [ ] Ensure run records and step records preserve runtime identity.
* [ ] Add tests for mixed-runtime execution plans.
* [ ] Add tests for mixed-runtime failure semantics.

#### 7. Favn as scheduler and orchestrator of record

**Status:** planned

**Scope**

Keep scheduling and orchestration responsibility inside Favn, even when execution is delegated to external runtimes.

**Todo list**

* [ ] Define scheduler behavior for externally backed assets.
* [ ] Ensure external runtime runs are initiated through Favn scheduling and runtime APIs.
* [ ] Prevent split-brain orchestration between Favn and external runtimes.
* [ ] Ensure run history, retries, cancellation, and operator visibility stay centralized in Favn.
* [ ] Add tests that verify Favn remains the source of truth for orchestration state.

#### 8. External runtime observability ingestion

**Status:** planned

**Scope**

Ingest runtime details from dbt execution into Favn so operator tooling can inspect heterogeneous runs through one surface.

**Todo list**

* [ ] Define which dbt artifacts and execution metadata should be ingested.
* [ ] Map external runtime metadata into Favn event and run-step models.
* [ ] Preserve raw external execution details where useful for debugging.
* [ ] Add tests for ingestion of representative execution results.
* [ ] Document observability limits and guarantees across runtimes.

#### 9. Runtime plugin architecture for future integrations

**Status:** candidate

**Scope**

Design the integration architecture so dbt is the first external runtime, not the last. This should allow later support for other transformation systems such as SQLMesh without redesigning Favn around a single integration.

**Todo list**

* [ ] Generalize the external runtime contract beyond dbt-specific assumptions.
* [ ] Define plugin lifecycle and configuration model.
* [ ] Separate runtime-agnostic orchestration concerns from runtime-specific adapters.
* [ ] Add tests for plugin registration and mixed plugin catalogs.
* [ ] Document extension points for future runtimes.

#### 10. SQLMesh evaluation for future compatibility

**Status:** candidate

**Scope**

Evaluate SQLMesh as a potential future runtime so the v1 architecture does not unnecessarily lock Favn into dbt-only assumptions.

**Todo list**

* [ ] Compare dbt and SQLMesh integration requirements.
* [ ] Identify which runtime abstraction points are shared.
* [ ] Identify dbt-specific assumptions that should be avoided in core Favn APIs.
* [ ] Capture findings in an architecture note.

## Explicitly out of scope for this roadmap

The following item is intentionally not included here because it should live separately:

* a standalone example repository such as `favn-demo` for a fully workable cloneable app

That repository can support adoption and documentation, but it should not be treated as a core library roadmap item.
