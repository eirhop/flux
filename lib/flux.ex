defmodule Flux do
  @moduledoc """
  Flux is a library for defining, inspecting, and orchestrating asset-based workflows in Elixir.

  It is built around the idea that each step in a workflow should be expressed as a normal,
  business-oriented Elixir function, while Flux adds the metadata and orchestration needed to
  discover assets, understand their dependencies, and execute them as part of a run.

  Flux is intended to be the core library behind orchestrator applications, operator dashboards,
  scheduling systems, and other tools that need a stable API for working with assets and runs.

  ## What Flux provides

  Flux is designed for applications that need to:

    * define assets as plain Elixir functions
    * attach documentation and metadata directly to those assets through @asset annotations
    * declare dependencies between assets
    * inspect assets and their relationships at runtime
    * execute one asset or a dependency-derived workflow
    * inspect active and completed runs
    * subscribe to live events from a run

  ## Core concepts

  ### Assets

  An asset is a function that represents a meaningful unit of work in a workflow, such as
  extracting data, transforming a dataset, or producing a modeled output.

  Assets are intended to be authored in modules that `use Flux.Assets`. At compile time,
  Flux will collect metadata such as:

    * asset name
    * documentation
    * dependency references
    * source file and line
    * kind
    * tags

  This keeps the workflow definition close to the business logic while still allowing Flux to
  introspect and orchestrate the workflow later.

  ### Dependencies

  Assets can depend on other assets. Flux uses those dependency declarations to derive the
  execution graph automatically.

  Flux models those relationships as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), not as a strict tree.
  Shared upstream assets are therefore allowed, cycles are rejected, and a later runtime
  planner can ensure an asset runs at most once in a single run even when multiple downstream
  assets depend on it.

  In practice, this means users generally do not need to manually define pipelines. When an
  asset is run, Flux can compute the dependency graph for the requested target and form the
  execution pipeline from that graph.

  ### Runs

  A run is a single execution of a target asset.

  Depending on the runtime options, a run may include:

    * only the requested asset
    * the requested asset and its upstream dependencies

  Runs are intended to be observable and inspectable so that orchestrator applications can show
  progress, history, and live operational state.

  ### Live events

  Flux is intended to expose structured run events so that consumers can subscribe to the
  progress of an active run.

  This is designed for use cases such as:

    * live operator dashboards
    * streaming logs and status in a web UI
    * audit trails
    * hooks into telemetry or other observability systems

  ## Authoring assets

  Assets are defined in normal modules using `Flux.Assets`.

  A simplified example:

      defmodule MyApp.SalesETL do
        use Flux.Assets

        @doc "Extract raw orders from the sales source"
        @asset true
        def extract_orders(_ctx, _deps) do
          {:ok, %Flux.Asset.Output{output: [%{id: 1, total: 100}], meta: %{source: :sales}}}
        end

        @doc "Normalize extracted orders"
        @asset depends_on: [:extract_orders]
        def normalize_orders(_ctx, deps) do
          orders = Map.fetch!(deps, {__MODULE__, :extract_orders})

          normalized =
            Enum.map(orders, fn order ->
              Map.put(order, :normalized, true)
            end)

          {:ok, %Flux.Asset.Output{output: normalized, meta: %{normalized_count: length(normalized)}}}
        end
      end

  Cross-module dependencies are also expected to be supported:

      defmodule MyApp.GoldETL do
        use Flux.Assets

        alias MyApp.SalesETL

        @doc "Build the fact table for sales"
        @asset depends_on: [{SalesETL, :normalize_orders}]
        def fact_sales(_ctx, deps) do
          normalized_orders = Map.fetch!(deps, {SalesETL, :normalize_orders})
          {:ok, %Flux.Asset.Output{output: %{rows: normalized_orders}}}
        end
      end

  In this model, workflow structure is derived from the dependencies rather than from a
  separately maintained pipeline definition.

  ## Using the library

  `Flux` is the main public entrypoint for the library.

  Typical usage from an orchestrator app or operator tool:

      Flux.list_assets()

      Flux.list_assets(MyApp.SalesETL)

      Flux.get_asset({MyApp.SalesETL, :normalize_orders})

      Flux.upstream_assets({MyApp.GoldETL, :fact_sales})

      Flux.dependency_graph({MyApp.GoldETL, :fact_sales}, tags: [:warehouse])

      Flux.run({MyApp.GoldETL, :fact_sales})

      Flux.run({MyApp.GoldETL, :fact_sales}, dependencies: :none)

      Flux.get_run(run_id)

      Flux.list_runs()

      Flux.list_runs(status: :running)

      Flux.subscribe_run(run_id)

  ## Setup in a host application

  Flux is an OTP application, not a standalone server you start with a
  dedicated `flux` command.

  A consumer application typically sets Flux up in four steps:

    1. add `:flux` as a dependency in `mix.exs`
    2. define one or more asset modules with `use Flux.Assets`
    3. register those modules under `config :flux, asset_modules: [...]`
    4. start the host application normally

  Flux is not published on Hex yet, so today it should be installed directly
  from the repository. A minimal dependency declaration looks like this:

      defp deps do
        [
          {:flux, git: "https://github.com/eirhop/flux.git", branch: "main"}
        ]
      end

  Once Hex publishing exists, the dependency can move to a normal versioned
  package declaration:

      defp deps do
        [
          {:flux, "~> 0.1.0"}
        ]
      end

  Asset modules usually live in the host application's normal source tree,
  for example under `lib/my_app/`.

  Once those modules exist, register them in the host application's config.
  For most projects that means `config/config.exs`, optionally overridden from
  environment-specific files such as `config/dev.exs`, `config/test.exs`, or
  `config/runtime.exs` if the application needs environment-dependent module
  lists.

      import Config

      config :flux,
        asset_modules: [
          MyApp.SalesETL,
          MyApp.GoldETL
        ]

  The configured module list is the global discovery scope used by
  `Flux.list_assets/0` and `Flux.get_asset/1`.

  Run event subscriptions use Phoenix PubSub and default to `Flux.PubSub`.
  Host applications can override the pubsub server name:

      import Config

      config :flux,
        pubsub_name: MyApp.PubSub

  ## Starting Flux

  There is no separate Flux server process that operators start manually.

  When the host application boots, Mix starts the `:flux` application as a
  dependency, and `Flux.Application` loads the configured asset registry during
  application startup.

  In practice, that means the right startup command is the normal startup
  command for the host application:

    * `iex -S mix` for interactive local development
    * `mix run --no-halt` for a long-running non-interactive OTP process
    * framework-specific commands such as `mix phx.server` when Flux is used
      inside a Phoenix application

  If the host application is already running under releases, supervision, or a
  framework entrypoint, Flux starts automatically as part of that boot process.

  ## Configuration lifecycle

  The global asset registry is loaded from application config during startup and
  then kept in memory for fast lookups. Flux also builds a global dependency
  graph index during startup from that same canonical asset catalog.

  The graph index is intended to stay read-only for the lifetime of the booted
  node and supports DAG validation, upstream and downstream inspection,
  transitive dependency queries, and deterministic topological ordering for
  later execution planning.

  That means changes to `config :flux, asset_modules: [...]` are not picked up
  automatically by an already-running node. In normal usage, update the config
  and restart the host application so Flux reloads the configured registry and
  dependency graph during boot.

  ## Public API responsibilities

  The intended user-facing responsibilities of this module are:

    * asset discovery
    * asset inspection
    * dependency graph inspection
    * run execution
    * run inspection
    * listing historical runs
    * subscribing to live run events

  This module should stay a thin public facade. Core implementation details should live in
  dedicated modules underneath.

  ## Design goals

  Flux aims to keep workflow code close to the business domain while still providing the
  operational features needed by orchestration and observability tooling.

  In practice, that means:

    * business logic remains plain Elixir
    * documentation lives close to the asset definition
    * dependencies are simple and explicit
    * orchestration is derived from asset metadata
    * the public API stays small and stable
    * implementation details are pushed into focused modules

  ## Documentation policy

  Documentation ownership is split intentionally:

    * `README.md` is canonical for release status, roadmap planning, and the
      feature/limitation matrix.
    * `Flux` moduledoc is canonical for API behavior, contracts, and examples.
