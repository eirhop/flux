defmodule Favn.Storage.Adapter do
  @moduledoc """
  Behaviour for run persistence adapters.

  Run store adapters are the boundary between Favn runtime orchestration and
  concrete persistence backends.

  The default adapter in v0.1 is `Favn.Storage.Adapter.Memory`, which is node-local
  and non-durable. Future adapters (for example Postgres or SQLite) should
  implement this behaviour without changing the `Favn` public API.

  ## Required invariants

    * Run IDs are treated as globally unique identifiers.
    * `put_run/2` is idempotent for the same run ID.
    * `list_runs/2` returns deterministic newest-first ordering.
    * Adapters should return `{:error, :not_found}` for missing run IDs.

  ## Lifecycle

  Adapters may expose a `child_spec/1` function and return either:

    * `{:ok, child_spec}` when supervision is required
    * `:none` when no process lifecycle is needed
