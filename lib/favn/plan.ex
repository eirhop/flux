  Deterministic execution plan for one logical run request.

  Plans are built from a target set and a dependency mode. Nodes are deduplicated
  by canonical asset reference so shared dependencies execute at most once.

  `stages` groups refs by topological depth so each stage can run in parallel
  after all refs in previous stages are satisfied.
